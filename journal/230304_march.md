##### IDE?

Seems like I'm gonna need an IDE or something.

Let's not mess up my vim conf. I'll probably go with DrRacket or Emacs.

Emacs + Vim is a thing. Spacemacs and magit looks cool. So does orgmode.

BUT... I'm not in the mood for dealing with conf...

ok. let's not get fixated on this.

I'm gonna learn emacs so that I can use any LISP, and that'll solve the problem.
And I'm gonna use DrRacket when I'm learning Racket.
When in doubt, I don't chose. I just do everything at once.

First encounter with DrRacket: not smooth.

Let's do emacs.

# Which LISP

The article I was reading was recommending Guile

I've installed Guile 3 and Racket 8.

I have no idea what I'm doing to be honest.

...

I've installed clojure lol. with lein. I'm following instructions from Clojure for the Brave and True. Pretty smooth. There's an emacs tutorial inside. Maybe that could be useful.
