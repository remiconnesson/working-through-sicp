i've set up drracket in wsl, it should work.

It looks like I've lost a bunch of the code I had written last session.

That's weird but hey.


I've discovered that racket has a sicp package to emulate the version used in sicp.
That's great.
Also it seems racket is more powerful than I perceived initially.
People say it's like a language to program languages. I don't quite get it but we will see, maybe?
